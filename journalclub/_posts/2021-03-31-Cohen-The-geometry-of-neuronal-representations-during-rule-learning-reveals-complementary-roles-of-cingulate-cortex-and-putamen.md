#### Abstract
Learning new rules and adopting novel behavioral policies is a prominent adaptive behavior of primates. We studied the dynamics of single neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and putamen of monkeys while they learned new classification tasks every few days over a fixed set of multi-cue patterns. Representing the rules and the neuronal selectivity as vectors in the space spanned by a set of stimulus features allowed us to characterize neuronal dynamics in geometrical terms. We found that neurons in the cingulate cortex mainly rotated toward the rule, implying a policy search, whereas neurons in the putamen showed a magnitude increase that followed the rotation of cortical neurons, implying strengthening of confidence for the newly acquired rule-based policy. Further, the neural representation at the end of a session predicted next-day behavior, reflecting overnight retention. The novel framework for characterization of neural dynamics suggests complementing roles for the putamen and the anterior cingulate cortex.
