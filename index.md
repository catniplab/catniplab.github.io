CATNIP Lab is a computational and statistical neuroscience group.
Our goal is to obtain an __effective systems-level description__ of relevant neural dynamics in the context of cognitive functions and dysfunctions.
To arrive at a model of neural computation tightly tied to biology and experimental observations, we work closely with experimental and clinical collaborators.
We develop probabilistic methods for analyzing spatiotemporal neural and non-neural time series to infer __neural dynamics models__.
To facilitate the scientific inference process, we develop __real-time machine learning and control__ methods and design next-generation experiments.

See [research page](research) for details.
