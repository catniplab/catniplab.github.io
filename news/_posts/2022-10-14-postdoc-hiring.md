The [Neural Dynamics Lab](https://fchampalimaud.org/research/groups/memming-park), also known as the [CATNIP Lab](catniplab.github.io/), headed by Memming Park at the [Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal](https://fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-research), is looking for talented next generation scientists and engineers to advance neurotechnology and neural data analysis tools to better understand neural dynamics.
Our broad goal is to obtain an effective systems-level description of relevant neural dynamics in the context of cognitive functions and dysfunctions, such as working memory, decision-making, motor control, and disorders of consciousness.

The main technological objectives of the current project are to enable real-time interface with neural systems, so that we can (1) infer the internal state and dynamics during the experiments, and (2) improve the efficiency of data acquisition through active-learning.
Specifically, we will exploit the shared structure of neural ensembles across datasets and deploy *meta-learning* approaches for a faster inference, and develop better *mathematical tools* based on dynamical systems that provides an interpretable description of underlying neural computation.
The project will involve tight collaboration with experimental labs and related software/hardware systems.

The two postdoc positions are supported by an NIH award titled "Adaptive statistical algorithms for learning and control of neural dynamics".
We are seeking scientists and engineers with a strong background in neuroscience, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, machine learning, dynamical systems, statistics, and/or applied mathematics.

Come join the thriving reseach community at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown!

Application deadline is November 19, 2022.
